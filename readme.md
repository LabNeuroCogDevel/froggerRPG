# Frog Task
Forced choice exploration with variable rewards and intermitate anti-saccade events.

[Striatal dopamine supports reward expectation and learning: A simultaneous PET/fMRI study (Neuroimage 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119831)
> In the task, participants controlled a frog avatar on a 3 × 3 map which consisted of a grid superimposed on three landmark images. Each map location was pre-determined to have a randomized reward probability of 20%, 50%, or 80%. Three grid locations were assigned to each probability level, and the map layout was chosen to avoid common patterns (e.g., three high reward squares in a row). The underlying probabilities were maintained throughout the six task runs. Participants were instructed to explore the ‘map’ to find the cells with most rewards thus encouraging them to learn probability contingencies in order to maximize their earnings (up to $25) over the course of the entire session.
